# ## 1. 

# x = 16 - 2 * 5 // 3 + 1
# y = 2 ** 3 * 3

# # what is x?
x = 16 - 2 * 5 // 3 + 1
x = 14
# # what is y?
y = 2 ** 3 * 3
y = 24

# # Describe the order that the computation occurred in each case. i.e which happened first, followed by which one, etc.
# #Solution:
# #Following the rule of PEMDAS
x = 14
#firstly, multiplication of 2 * 5 = 10
#secondly, floor division od 10 // 3 = 3
#thirdly, Subtraction of 16 - 3 = 13
# Lastly, Addition of 13 + 1 = 14  

# #Following the rule of PEMDAS
y = 24
# Firstly, Exponential of 2 ** 3 = 8
# Lastly, Multiplication of 8 * 3 = 24
